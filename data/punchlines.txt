Stairs 
On a diet 
You look a bit flushed.
Because it was framed. 
I'll meet you at the corner.
Write on! 
Lonely.
A towel.
Because they are two-tired!
So they can fight knights!
Someday my prints will come!
It over swept!
The wheels, because they are always tired!
Stick with me and we will go places!
An Avon lady at the North Pole!
No, I was the same size I am now!
Because he was sitting on the deck!
Keep your shirt on!
Ever try swatting a fly with a TV?
I think I'm coming down with something!
Because it help up some pants!
They had just finished aMarch of 31 days.
Neither, it's best to write with a pen!
Because then it would be a foot!
Because it has a lot of dates!
He wanted to find Pluto!
Grass..... I lied about the wheels!
Her nose!
Two clothes pins held up a pair of pants!
Because the bed won't come to you!
Because he couldn't find a date!
Because it's too cold out-tide!
Put your head through a window and the pane will just disappear!
A garbage truck!
A minnie van!
Because they take too long to change!
To catch up on his sleep!
He wanted to make a clean get away!
